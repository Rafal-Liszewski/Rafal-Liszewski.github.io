<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>Rafal Liszewski is an emerging artist from Adelaide, South Australia who is exploring oil paint and gouache on various materials.
</br></br>
He graduated from the University of South Australia in 2016 with a Bachelor of Visual Communication (Communication Design). He co-established Small Room at The Mill where he practiced as a graphic designer for five years.
</br></br>
At The Mill he participated in three group exhibitions exploring the process of a designer, experimenting with the method and materials of screen-printing and creating an installation that focused on studio practise, the internet, childhood and nostalgia. During his time at Small Room he practiced autodidactic studies in art theory, painting and illustration.
</br></br>
From April to June 2021 he has commenced an Emerging Artist Residency at The PaintBox in Hahndorf resulting in ‘Tell Me More,’ an exhibition that explores the theme of ambiguity in the application of materials and painting techniques; in particular oil paint. The aim of this ambiguity is to transform the realities of the reference and to create a narrative and atmosphere that engages audiences.
</br></br>
Rafal will be continuing to develop his artistic skills as he becomes an established artist in Adelaide.</p>
