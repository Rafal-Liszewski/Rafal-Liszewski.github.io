                <td class="frontPage">
                <p>Rafal Liszewski is Adelaide born, Naarm/Melbourne based. Graduated from the University of South Australia in 2016 with a Bachelor of Visual Communication (Communication Design). Then co-established Small Room at The Mill (Adelaide) where he practiced as a graphic designer for creative individuals and businesses for five years.
</br></br>
Pivoting into oil painting in 2021 with his first solo show and residency "Tell Me More" at The Paintbox, Hahndorf in the Adelaide hills. This began his natural obsession of traditional techniques and art materials throughout painting history. Leading into the first experimental forays of colour theory in 2023 within the second solo exhibition "Age of Scopa" at Brunswick Street Gallery, Melbourne.
</br></br>
Rafal will continue exploring traditional techniques and materials to discover connections that can be utilized to further his practice. His current focus is in the perception of movement within paintings.</p>
