            <p> This is my home. I live here. I have tidied up the place.
                It is now used as a place to record my progression through various skills and subjects.
                To set various goals and structures. A place that I am able to look back upon and rediscover myself.
                A space for relection and meditation. This is my home and I am god here.

            <p>
                I am not sure how this will be structured, here is an attempt. </br></br>
                small room - </br>
                A graphic design studio started with <a href="http://lachlan-stewart.com/">LACHLAN STEWART</a>, <a href="http://angusplunkett.com/">ANGUS PLUNKETT</a>. This is our <a href="http://smallroom.com.au/">WEBSITE</a>. Currently working there on multiple small projects and two large ones. </br></br>
                Our progress through the year.</br>
                [####========]</br></br>
                instagram - </br>
                it is an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/raf_lisz/">ART ONLY</a> instagram which shows various paintings and drawings that i have made over the years. i enjoy art history & various visual media.
				currently painting in gouache & oils which is exciting for me due to working primarily in acrylics before. </br></br>
                hobbies - </br>
                i have also dabbled in hand thrown pottery, weaving, gardening, programming & wood working to varying degrees of personal success & failure. </br></br>
                twitter - </br>
                i mainly use this <a href="https://twitter.com/raf_lisz?lang=en">PLATFORM</a> to talk random shit or retweeting things that i find interesting, fun, etc. </br></br>
                are.na - </br>
                a new structure that i find interesting, although it has developed it's own faults like the rest of the platforms on the internet. they are minor compared to what it provides. i mainly use it as a <a href="https://www.are.na/rafal-liszewski">MOOD BOARD</a> for projects, sharing projects, ideas and images for small room.
