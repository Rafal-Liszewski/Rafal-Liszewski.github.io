				currently working at <a href="http://smallroom.com.au/">SMALL ROOM</a>, a graphic design studio that was originally created by <a href="http://lachlan-stewart.com/">LACHLAN STEWART</a>, <a href="http://angusplunkett.com/">ANGUS PLUNKETT</a> & myself.
				it has been in creation for 3 years & involved in various design projects in the arts, self made posters & creative individual clients. this is my <a href="">PORTFOLIO/CV</a> (currently being re-edited). i enjoy art history & various visual media.
				currently painting in gouache & oils which is exciting for me due to working primarily in acrylics before. my paintings & drawings can be seen on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/raf_lisz/">INSTAGRAM</a>.
				i have also dabbled in hand thrown pottery, weaving, gardening, programming & wood working to varying degrees of personal success & failure. i talk mad shit on <a href="https://twitter.com/raf_lisz?lang=en">TWITTER</a>. the things that inspire me & that
				i am involved in can be found through the visual mood pools on <a href="https://www.are.na/rafal-liszewski">ARE.NA</a>.
