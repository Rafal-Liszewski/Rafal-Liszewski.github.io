            <p>Working as a designer trapped within a small octahedron crystal within <a href="http://www.smallroom.com.au/">small room.</a>
            Illustration work kept on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/raf_lisz/">instagram</a> but i should probably change that if i want to own the rights to my own work.
            Aesthetics & thoughts within <a href="https://twitter.com/raf_lisz">twitter</a>, realistically it is just me complaining about random stuff & trying to support interesting creative projects but i guess once i figure out some sort of work flow i will post more.
