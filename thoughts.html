            <p>Currently making the new™ website. Feeling pretty good with the general layout and multiple use of pages. In the past i have mainly created one page websites which is super convenient but can be messy and annoying on load times? I dunno. Anyway im enjoying the structure, kind of like my own replacement of link.tree or whatever it is. So yeah, pretty happy and don't know how formal or informal i'm going to keep these sections but i guess we will see. </p>
