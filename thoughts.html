            <h2>Wednesday - 3rd February - 2021</h2>
            <p>On Monday the 1st I made an easel. It was a simple foldable easel so that i can place thicker canvases on it without them falling off. Was made from various old scraps of timber and the slats of an old bed. The feeling of setting a task to do and completing it from start to finish without any measurements ready is a spontaneity i want to bring over to my illustrating and painting practice. Although care must be made to avoid being sloppy, it's the carefree feeling that i want to bring over. To not worry and simply work with the materials, lighting, composition that i have and put the same amount of energy i did with the easel. At the end of the day something will be created, something will be learned and skills developed.</p>

            <p>Currently making the new™ website. Feeling pretty good with the general layout and multiple use of pages. In the past i have mainly created one page websites which is super convenient but can be messy and annoying on load times? I dunno. Anyway im enjoying the structure, kind of like my own replacement of link.tree or whatever it is. So yeah, pretty happy and don't know how formal or informal i'm going to keep these sections but i guess we will see. </p>
