						<h2>Monday - 19th 2022</h2>
						<p> I have moved to Melbourne. I had Covid19. I was involved in a group exhibition. I was depressed for months. Change only exists if you put the first foot forward. Where I am now, I feel confident in doing something, anything; for to do nothing almost feels like self-destruction. Yet it feels quite difficult putting that foot forward if you have no belief in yourself. Excited to do something with the one life given to me. Due to living in a small apartment, I want to learn the art of growing bonsai's. A tree that can come with me.</p>

            <h2>Sunday - 18th July 2021</h2>
            <p>So much has changed from the last time I wrote here. To think it was only 5 months ago is unbelievable to me. Terrible and wonderful events have come and passed, I don't even feel like the same person that wrote back in February. Wondering how these events have shaped me and my future thoughts just feels like I have no true perception of time. Regardless, I've had a wonderful July as I have had my first solo exhibition opening! It was a wonderful night, amazing the people that came and showed their support and to see them again. Massive thank you's to those who have financially supported me. I hope this will aid me in future artistic endeavors. Here's to my patrons!</p>

            <h2>Wednesday - 3rd February - 2021</h2>
            <p>On Monday the 1st I made an easel. It was a simple foldable easel so that i can place thicker canvases on it without them falling off. Was made from various old scraps of timber and the slats of an old bed. The feeling of setting a task to do and completing it from start to finish without any measurements ready is a spontaneity i want to bring over to my illustrating and painting practice. Although care must be made to avoid being sloppy, it's the carefree feeling that i want to bring over. To not worry and simply work with the materials, lighting, composition that i have and put the same amount of energy i did with the easel. At the end of the day something will be created, something will be learned and skills developed.</p>

            <h2>Friday - 11th December - 2020</h2>
            <p>Currently making the new™ website. Feeling pretty good with the general layout and multiple use of pages. In the past i have mainly created one page websites which is super convenient but can be messy and annoying on load times? I dunno. Anyway im enjoying the structure, kind of like my own replacement of link.tree or whatever it is. So yeah, pretty happy and don't know how formal or informal i'm going to keep these sections but i guess we will see. </p>
